	=== Google Scholar Gateway Plugin
	=================================


The Google Scholar gateway plugin generates an XML digest of the various
articles in an OJS installation. It can be addressed at the following
URL pattern:

http://localhost/ojs2/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/GoogleScholarPlugin

...where, of course, localhost is the local server name, ojs2 is the path
to the OJS 2.x installation, and myJournal is the path to a particular
journal.

The plugin must be enabled and the journal must supply certain pieces of
information that are not required by default by OJS but are necessary for
Google Scholar. To enable the plugin, or ensure that it is sufficiently
configured, log into the Journal Manager's "System Plugins" page, find the
Google Scholar Gateway Plugin under the "Gateway Plugins" heading, and
click "Enable" or "Settings", respectively.

This plugin ships with current releases of OJS 2.x and the PKP support
team may be contacted for more information. See docs/README.
