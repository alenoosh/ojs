		<![CDATA[<p>The journal provides Authors with the ability to upload their submission directly to the journal web site. Author wishing to submit an item to the journal needs to first register with the journal web site. On doing so, the Author will have the option of also registering as a Reviewer and a Reader.  On completing the registration process, the Author is taken directly to User Home, listing the various roles under which the Author is enrolled. Clicking on the role of Author, takes the Author to the submissions page, where a list of current and past submissions are listed, and where a new submission can be initiated. The Submission process is broken down into five steps, with guidance provided at each step. Authors do not need to complete the five steps at one go, but can return to what will be listed as an "Incomplete".</p>]]>
