		<![CDATA[<p>The Author is able to upload the Supplementary Files in Step 4 of the Submission Process. The Supplementary Files are intended to include research data sets, research instruments, source texts or other materials that might otherwise form an appendix to the submission but warrant being treated as separate documents as they may have value on their own merits. In addition, the Supplementary Files will be indexed by the Author, independently of the submission, enabling the Files to be part of a larger index and found by those looking for these particular type of items.</p><p><i>Supplementary File formats</i>. Supplementary Files are also uploaded in their original file format - and on which they are no restrictions - and remain in that format, as opposed to the rest of the submission which must be in a standard manuscript format and will be transposed into a standard publication format. This means that data sets in spread sheets or flash demonstrations can be uploaded and preserved in that format. This may pose challenges to readers, which Authors need to take into account, perhaps by providing in the description of the file, where the requisite "reader" to open and view this File can be found.</p>]]>
