		<![CDATA[<p>The User Home appears in the navigation bar at the page, after the user has logged in. It lists all of the roles in which the user is currently enrolled (e.g., Reviewer, Author, Reader, etc.). It also includes the user's Account, which includes links to the other journals in which the user is registered in one or more roles. My Account also provides access to the user's Profile where contact and biographical information can be added or edited. The user is also able to create a new password as part of their account management in the User Home.</p>]]>
