		<![CDATA[<p>The journal's homepage or Home in the navigation bar at the top of the journal's pages can be used by the Journal Manager to display the Table of Contents for the current edition of the journal or the cover for that edition. It can also carry announcements for the journal, or news of upcoming events related to the journal and perhaps its sponsoring organization. Readers need only to click on Current in the navigation bar at the top of the Homepage and all other pages to be brought to the cover or Table of Contents for the current issue.</p>]]>
