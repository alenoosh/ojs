		<![CDATA[<p>To ensure that the identities of the authors and reviewers are not known to each other, the following steps should be taken: 
<ol><li>The authors of the document should ensure that their names are deleted from the text, with "Author" and year used in the references and footnotes, instead of authors' name, title, etc.</li>
<li>With Microsoft Office documents, author identification should also be removed from the document's Properties by clicking on the following, beginning with File on the main menu of the Microsoft application: File > Save As > Tools (or Options with a Mac) > Security > Remove personal information from file properties on save > Save.</li>
<li>With PDFs, the authorsâ€™ names should also be removed from Document Properties found under File on Adobe Acrobat's main menu.</li>
