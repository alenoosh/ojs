The Author, completing a review of the galleys and Supplementary Files, if any, sends a completion email to the Proofreader, with a cc. to the Section Editor Any typos or formatting errors are noted by the Author, as well as by Proofreader, in the Corrections text-box in Proofreading (since the Authors and Proofreaders cannot mark up the galleys). The Proofreader, on completing the reading of the galleys and Supplementary Files, if any, notifies the Layout Editor, with a cc. to the Section Editor, and the Layout Editor proceeds to correct the galleys and Supplementary Files, if any, and then, finally, notifies the Section Editor that the submission is ready to be scheduled for publication. At that point, the Section Editor may again wish to review the files, and if satisfied, schedule the submission for publication by clicking the appropriate button at the end of the page. The submission then enters the {help_topic key="publishing.index" text="Publishing Process"}.</p>]]>
