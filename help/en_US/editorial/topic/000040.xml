		<![CDATA[<p>The Layout Version of the submission has been prepared by the copyeditor to the journal's standards. The Layout Editor will layout the submission in the appropriate file formats and layout style for the journal. The Layout Editor will need to use third party-software to prepare the HTML, PDF, Postscript, etc. files (e.g., Dreamweaver, Front Page, Acrobat, etc.).  As well, the journal is able to make a set of Layout Instructions available to Layout Editors to assist them in properly formatting the files for publication.</p><p><i>Uploading files</i>. On uploading the file to Proof Format, the system will identify the file type and provide the Layout Editor an opportunity to label the file (although it is just as well to leave it identify the file type, such  as PDF), as well as provide information on the file size and its original name. The Layout Editor may upload additional file formats, delete files that have been uploaded, and edit information such as the file name. In uploading HTML files, the images and style sheet must also be uploaded with the .htm or .html file.</p><p><i>Supplementary files</i>. If the Author has uploaded any Supplementary Files, they  will already be in place. They are to be published in the journal in their original file format, unless the journal has a special policy with regard to their preparation (as with Figures or illustrations). Even if the policy is to publish them in their original format, the Layout Editor may still wish to consult the files to ensure that they are legible and to see whether they can be readily made to further conform to journal style and standards. Supplementary Files can be deleted, worked on, and uploaded again by the Layout Editor (as well as by the Author, if required because of aspects of the file format).</p>]]>
