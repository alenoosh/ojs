		<![CDATA[<p>Submissions in this queue are going through copyediting, layout and proofreading. When a Section Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title on the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission's Editing page. When a submission has gone through the editing stage and is sent to Scheduling (to be place in an issue), it is removed from this list and enters the Editor's Scheduling Queue.</p>]]>
