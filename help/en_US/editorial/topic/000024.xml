		<![CDATA[<p>The first task for the Section Editor with each submission is to check the text to whether the Original Version can serve as the Review Version or that a revised copy needs to be uploaded.  To view the Original File, the Section Editor clicks on the blue file name.</p><p><i>Ensuring a blind Peer Review</i>. For submissions undergoing a blind Peer Review, the Section Editor should check to see that all author identification has been removed from the file: (a) author's reference to their own work should use the convention of  "Author" plus year, and (b) the document's Properties should not include the author's name (with MS Word, look under the menu for File). The Section Editor should also consult the Submission page to check whether Supplementary Files can be shared with Reviewers. If the author felt the files could be presented to Reviewers, they will be checked (although the Section Editor can un-check them).</p><p><i>Establishing the submission's Review Version</i>. The Section Editor sets the Review Version  which Reviewers will see, by (a) selecting the Original Version, if it is suitable, or (b) by uploading a more suitable version. The Section Editor can choose to fix minor problems with the original file using a word processor to make the changes, saving the file to the desktop and then uploading the file, using the Browse/Upload buttons in Review Version.</p><p><i>Inadequately prepared submissions</i>. If the submission has clearly failed to adhere to the journal's Author Guidelines, including the need for a blind review, the Section Editor can elect to notify the author that the work needs to be resubmitted. The author can then resubmit the improved version directly to the editor by email, who can then upload it as the Review Version. The Section Editor can also decide that the submission is simply not suited for the journal and notify the author to that effect, while going to the Submission page and clicking "Archive Submission" sending to the Archives.</p>]]>
