		<![CDATA[<p>The Editorial Process for a submission to the journal consists of a review, typically a blind peer review, followed by a section editor's decision over whether to accept or decline the submission. That is the Review stage of the Editorial Process, and if accepted the submission then goes through the Editing stage which consists of copyediting, layout and proofreading, after which the submission is sent to be scheduled for publication in an issue of the journal. Depending on how the journal has been organized, the Editorial Process can be conducted by a single Editor or by a team of Editors, Sections Editors, Copyeditors, Layout Editors, and Proofreaders (see {help_topic key="journal.roles.index" text="People and Roles"}. This Help text describes the roles for each, as if the journal is using the full complement, although obviously one or more roles can be combined in one person.</p>]]>
