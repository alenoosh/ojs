		<![CDATA[<p>Submissions in this queue are subject to a review resulting in a decision by the Section Editor to accept or decline the submission. The extent of the review process -- Is every Section of the journal subject to Peer Review? How many peer Reviewers per submission? Etc. - is spelled out in the journal's Review Policy. When a Section Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title in the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission's Review page. If the Section Editor accepts a submission, it moves to the In Editing queue. If the submission is declined, it is moved to the Archives.</p>]]>
