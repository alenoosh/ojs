		<![CDATA[<p>Submissions in this queue are subject to review and a decision by the Section Editor is made to accept or decline the submission. The extent of the review process - Is every Section of the journal subject to Peer Review? How many peer Reviewers per submission? Etc. - is spelled out in the journal's Review Policy. When a Section Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title on the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission's Review page. If the Section Editor accepts a submission, it moves to the In Editing queue, while if it is declined it moves to the Archives.</p>]]>
