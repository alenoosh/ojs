		<![CDATA[<p>Each submission to the journal enters the Editors' Unassigned queue. To assigns a submissions in this list to a Section Editor, the Editor clicks on the submission's title, which takes the Editor to the appropriate Submission page. When a submission is assigned to a Section Editor, it moves from the Unassigned Queue to In Review Queue. If there is only one Section Editor associated with a Section, then submissions to that Section are automatically assigned to that person, and go immediately on submission from Unassigned to the In Review Queue.</p>]]>
