		<![CDATA[<p>The Section Editor oversees the copyediting, layout and proofreading by selecting and assigning members of the editorial team to see the submission through each stage, and by ensuring that the submission moves through the process in a timely fashion. The process begins when the Section Editor selects the Copyeditor and requests the copyediting of the submission. The Section Editor may want to select the Layout Editor and Proofreader at the same time (depending on how many of these distinct editorial roles the journal is using), or wait until preceding stage is complete.  To replace those selected, the Section Editor simply clicks Select again and assigns a new person, who will replace the existing assignee. The Editing stage is complete when the submission has completed the Proofreading stage, at which point the Section Editor sends it to be scheduled for publication.</p>]]>
