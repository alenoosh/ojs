		<![CDATA[<p>Once an accepted submission has completed the Editing process, the Section Editor sends it to Scheduling. There it appears in a Scheduling queue, and the Editor is able to place the submission in one of the live issues which have been created. Typically, the Editor will place the submission into the first available issue, but it may happen that an issue is "full" prior to its publication, or that an Editor wishes to place a submission in a later issue to ensure a range of topics in each issue or, on the other hand, to cluster a series of submissions on a single topic.</p><p><i>Continuous publishing of submissions</i>. If submission are being published continuously, as soon as they are ready, then the Editor schedules the submission in what is, in effect, the Current issue, and it will be published as soon as its place in the Table of Contents has been checked. At the end of a Volume year, the next submission will be scheduled to appear in the new Volume, for which the Table of Contents will be published or made Current with this initial submission.</p>]]>
