		<![CDATA[<p>The Editor needs to create at least one issue in order to begin scheduling submissions for publication. The issue needs to be identified with the appropriate numbers, depending on the option chose in Setup (e.g., Vol 2, No 5, 2008). Issues also have the option of having a title added, to the Table of Contents, which can be used, for example, for special issues of the journal. The Editor may wish to ensure that there are always a series of 2-3 live, unpublished issues, which enables submissions to be scheduled over a couple of issues for reasons of balance or for some other reason. While the system will prompt the Editor with the next issue, each time an issue is to be created, the Editor can over-ride these settings and enter a new set of numbers or a different year.</p><p><i>Creating a cover page</i>. There is also the option of uploading a cover illustration for the journal, in the form of a .jpg, .png or .gif file. This file will be accessible through the Table of Contents where it will be listed as Cover Page. It will appear on the journal's homepage while the journal issue is Current, and can be clicked on to reach the Table of Contents for that issue. Once the issue is archived, the cover will remain available with the issue through the Table of Contents.</p>]]>
