		<![CDATA[<p>The Editor oversees entire editorial and publishing process. The Editor, working with the Journal Manager, typically establishes the policies and procedures for the journal, which are used in setting up the journal in {help_topic key="journal.managementPages.setup" text="Setup"}. In the Editorial Process, the Editor assigns submissions to the Section Editors to see through Submission Review and Submission Editing, while, keeping an eye on the submission's progress and assisting with any difficulties in the process. The Editor typically also plays the role of Section Editor in the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.editing" text="Editing"} process, seeing accepted submissions through copyediting, layout, and proofreading, although in some journals this remains the responsibility of the Section Editor who saw the submission through the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.review" text="Review"} process. The Editor also schedules submissions for publication, arranges the Table of Contents and publishes the issue, as part of the {help_topic key="publishing.index" text="Publishing Process"}.</p>]]>
