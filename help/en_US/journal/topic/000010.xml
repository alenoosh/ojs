		<![CDATA[<p>The Files Browser allows journal managers to peruse and manage the hierarchy of files uploaded for the journal (including all files uploaded through submission management). Files can be viewed, deleted, and moved as if interacting with a local file system.</p>
		<p>Note that this is intended as an administrative facility only and will generally not be needed in the day-to-day management of the journal.</p>]]>
