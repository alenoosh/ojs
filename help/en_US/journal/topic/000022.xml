		<![CDATA[<p>Authors are able to register and submit items to the journal directly through the journal's website. The Author is asked to upload the item and to provide metadata or indexing information on the item. (The metadata improves the search capacity for research online and for this journal.) The Author can upload Supplementary Files, in the form of data sets, research instruments, or source texts that will enrich the item, as well as contribute to more open and robust forms of research and scholarship. The Author is able to track the submission through the editorial process -- as well as participate in the copyediting and proofreading of submissions accepted for publication -- by logging in to the journal's website.</p>]]>
