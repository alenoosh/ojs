		<![CDATA[<p>The Journal Manager can select a set of appropriate Reading Tools from among the generic and discipline-based examples provided under Reading Tools on the Journal Management page (with specialized sets for Humanities, Education, Physics, etc.). These Tools enable the Reader to consult relevant information that adds to the context of the item which they are reading. The goal of the tools is to provide a richer context for the reading experience of novice and expert readers within the scope of the journal's coverage. The Journal Manager is able to edit or delete existing resources and add new ones as well. Also see {help_topic key="user.readingTools" text="Reading Tools"} under Journal Web Site.</p>]]>
