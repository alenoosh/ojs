		<![CDATA[<p>The Journal Manager is able to select a set of Reading Tools that will appear in a frame to the right of all items in sections of the journal that are indexed (e.g., Articles and not Conference Announcements). The Reading Tools are designed to assist experienced and novice readers by providing a rich context of related materials from a wide variety of largely open access sources. The tools use an author's keywords to automatically search a relevant open access database for related materials which are presented to the reader in another window. Readers have a choice of tools, and within each tool a choice of databases, along with access to information about the database.</p><p>In Settings, the Journal Manager can select generic tools, such as "Bibliographic info" and "Indexing info" as well as select a set of discipline or area specific resources (e.g., Humanities, Education, Physics, etc.). The Journal Manager is able to edit or delete existing resources and add new ones as well. Also see {help_topic key="user.readingTools" text="Reading Tools"} under Journal Web Site.</p>]]>
