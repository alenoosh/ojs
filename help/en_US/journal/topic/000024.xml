		<![CDATA[<p>OJS uses email to coordinate the functioning of the editorial and publishing process. All of the prepared emails have default versions, which come up each time the relevant email icon is clicked. The default emails can edited by the Journal Manager at any point. As well, an email can be edited by the sender prior to mailing it. When an email icon is clicked, it will have the intended recipient automatically filled in, along with all of the pertinent information needed for the editorial or publishing function. The sender can add comments or further direction, as needed. The sender can alter the recipient’s email address and additional recipients, except in those cases that do not involve the sending of passwords (for security reasons). Note that correcting a recipient’s address does not alter the email address listed on their Profile page in this system. Correcting the recipient’s email address on a permanent basis for this system requires notifying the Journal Manager, who has the authority to make such changes to users’ Profiles.</p>]]>
