		<![CDATA[<p>The Journal Manager is able to enroll people in the system and assign them to one or more roles in the editorial and publishing process. On logging in, the Journal Manager is taken to Journal Management, where the options include creating a new user, importing a set of new users, emailing users. The Journal Manager is also able to access the users registered under each of the roles, as well as add people to those roles. The Journal Manager is the one who can enroll people in different roles, although Editors and Section Editors can sign up Reviewers. On other hand, Authors and Readers can sign themselves up, as well as volunteer as Reviewers.</p>]]>
