		<![CDATA[<p>The Section Editor manages the Review and Editing of submissions in those Sections (e.g., Articles, Book Reviews, etc.) for which they have responsibilities. In some cases, a Section Editor assigned to see a submission through the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.review" text="Review"} Process will also see that submission if accepted for publication, through the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.editing" text="Editing"} process, that is, through copyediting, layout, and proofreading, but often not, with the Editor taking on the role of Section Editor for the Editing process. The journal will have a policy on how the tasks are divided.</p>]]>
