Technical Questions/Problems
============================

   1) When I try to access my OJS site this error message is displayed:
      "Warning: Smarty error: problem creating directory '/./templates' in
      ./lib/smarty/Smarty.class.php"

A: This can occur if a higher level directory has execute permission but not
   read permission. In these situations, the __FILE__ value in an included file
   appears to be relative to the location of the including file. This issue can
   be resolved by ensuring all parent directories are both readable and
   executable.

   See also this PHP bug report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16231>.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) Uploads of large files fail inexplicably.
 
A: This can be caused by certain Apache or PHP settings.

   Apache 2.x has a LimitRequestBody directive that, if set to a low number, can
   lead to this behaviour. In particular, the default PHP packages for recent
   versions of Red Hat Linux set LimitRequestBody to 524288 bytes in
   /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf.

   Low values for the PHP ini settings like post_max_size (default "8M"),
   upload_max_filesize (default "8M"), and memory_limit (default "8M") can also
   cause this problem.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) I am using a Windows server, and emails sent out by the system are never
      received.

A: On Windows you need to configure PHP to send email through a SMTP server
   (running either on the same machine or another machine).
   
   See <http://www.php.net/mail> for more details on configuring PHP mail
   functionality under Windows.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) I am using Apache 2.0.x, and OJS pages fail to load, producing an error
      like "File does not exist: .../index.php/index/...".

A: With some versions or configurations of Apache 2.0.x, it may be necessarily
   to explicitly enable the AcceptPathInfo directive in your Apache
   configuration file.
   
   See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html for more information about
   this directive.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) Numerous "Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated"
      messages appear when I load the OJS installer.

A: These warnings can be suppressed by setting allow_call_time_pass_reference to
   "On" in your php.ini configuration; this is the default value of this setting
   in recent versions of PHP, but some distributions of PHP may have this
   setting "Off" by default.
   
   It is anticipated that the requirement to have allow_call_time_pass_reference
   enabled will be removed in a future version of OJS.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6) Will OJS work in a PHP-CGI environment?
      Will OJS work in a Microsoft IIS environment?

A: Limited testing by PKP has indicated that OJS will likely not function
   correctly in these server environments. It is unknown what the scope is of
   modifying OJS to work in these environments, but any developers with
   experience in these areas are encouraged to contribute patches and bug fixes.
   
   Currently Apache with PHP as a shared module is the suggested configuration
   for running OJS. Other setups may or may not be better supported in future
   versions of OJS.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   7) OJS installation fails with the MySQL error "Client does not support
      authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL
      client".

A: This problem is caused by a change in the MySQL authentication protocol in
   MySQL 4.1, and can occur if your system is using an older MySQL client
   library with a newer MySQL server.

   See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html for suggested
   approaches to resolve this issue.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   8) How can I create a backup of an OJS site?

A: It is strongly recommended that an OJS system be periodically backed up to
   guard against a failure in OJS or the server software or hardware that could
   result in data loss.
   
   To properly backup an OJS system, the following should be backed up:
     - The OJS database, using the tools provided by your DBMS (e.g.,
       mysqldump for MySQL, pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
     - The base OJS directory
     - The non-public files directory (the directory specified by the
       "files_dir" configuration option)
       
   This backup procedure can be easily integrated into any automated backup
   mechanism.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   9) How can I move an existing OJS installation to a different server?

A: To move an OJS system from one server to another, you will need to:

   - Copy the database data, and import it into the new server (e.g., using the
     command-line tools provided by the DBMS)
   - Copy the base OJS directory and non-public files directory
   - Update config.inc.php with any changed settings for the new server
     (typically, the database authentication/access settings and the path to the
     non-public files directory)

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   10) "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session
       module's ini settings at this time" messages appear when I load OJS.

A: Check if session.auto_start is enabled in your php.ini configuration. OJS
   requires this setting to be disabled, which is the default behaviour in
   current versions of PHP.



==============================
Advanced Configuration Options
==============================

   1) How can I control the address to which bounced emails will be sent?
      Why do messages sent with an envelope sender have an 'X-Warning' header?

A: To control the address to which a bounced emails will be sent, you need to
   set the envelope sender address. Enable the "allow_envelope_sender" option
   in the [email] section of the OJS 2.x configuration file; when this option
   is enabled, a "Bounce Address" field appears on Page 2 of the Journal Setup.

   Note that this option may require changes to the server's mail server
   configuration so that the user the web server runs as (e.g. "www-data") is
   trusted by the sendmail program, or an "X-Warning" header will be added to
   outgoing messages. Consult your mail server's documentation if outgoing mails
   include such a header.
   
   For example, Sendmail keeps a list of trusted users in the file
   "/etc/mail/trusted-users";  other mail systems use similar files.
   The command-line option used by OJS 2.x to set the envelope sender is "-f".

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) How can I allow users to search non-text files, such as PDF or Microsoft
      Word documents?

A: OJS supports indexing of non-text files via external conversion applications.
   The "Search Settings" configuration section in config.inc.php can be modified
   to enable indexing of certain binary file formats by setting the "index_XXX"
   setting to the appropriate external text converter for that file format.

   Note that additional third-party software must be installed to use this
   feature (such as "pdftotext" for PDF files).
