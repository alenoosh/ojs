Technical Questions/Problems
============================

   1) When I try to access my OJS site this error message is displayed:
      "Warning: Smarty error: problem creating directory '/./templates' in
      ./lib/smarty/Smarty.class.php"

A: This can occur if a higher level directory has execute permission but not
   read permission. In these situations, the __FILE__ value in an included file
   appears to be relative to the location of the including file. This issue can
   be resolved by ensuring all parent directories are both readable and
   executable.

   See also this PHP bug report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16231>.

   2) Uploads of large files fail inexplicably.
 
A: This can be caused by certain Apache or PHP settings.

   Apache 2.x has a LimitRequestBody directive that, if set to a low number, can
   lead to this behaviour. In particular, the default PHP packages for recent
   versions of Red Hat Linux set LimitRequestBody to 524288 bytes in
   /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf.

   Low values for the PHP ini settings like post_max_size (default "8M"),
   upload_max_filesize (default "8M"), and memory_limit (default "8M") can also
   cause this problem.

   3) I am using a Windows server, and emails sent out by the system are never
      received.

A: On Windows you need to configure PHP to send email through a SMTP server
   (running either on the same machine or another machine).
   
   See <http://www.php.net/mail> for more details on configuring PHP mail
   functionality under Windows.

   4) How can I control the address to which bounced emails will be sent?
      Why do messages sent with an envelope sender have an 'X-Warning' header?

A: To control the address to which a bounced emails will be sent, you need to
   set the envelope sender address. Enable the "allow_envelope_sender" option
   in the [email] section of the OJS 2.x configuration file; when this option
   is enabled, a "Bounce Address" field appears on Page 2 of the Journal Setup.

   Note that this option requires that the user the web server runs as (e.g.
   "www-data") is trusted by the sendmail program, or an 'X-Warning' header
   will be added to outgoing messages. Sendmail keeps a list of trusted users
   in the file "/etc/mail/trusted-users"; other mail systems use similar files.
   The command-line option used by OJS 2.x to set the envelope sender is "-f".
