OJS Release Procedure
---------------------

The following steps (subject to change) are typically performed to prepare a new
OJS release:


1. Update version, installation, and upgrade descriptor files:

    dbscripts/xml/version.xml
    dbscripts/xml/install.xml
    dbscripts/xml/upgrade.xml


2. Update release documentation:

    docs/README
    docs/release-notes/README-<VERSION>


3. Generate CVS ChangeLog for the release:

    perl tools/cvs2cl.pl --delta <OLD-TAG>:<CURRENT-TAG> -f \
        docs/release-notes/ChangeLog-<VERSION>


4. Copy the current changelog and release notes to docs/:

    cp docs/release-notes/ChangeLog-<VERSION> docs/ChangeLog
    cp docs/release-notes/README-<VERSION> docs/RELEASE


5. After committing any pending modifications, tag the release in CVS:

    cvs rtag ojs-<MAJOR>_<MINOR>_<REVISION>-<BUILD> ojs2


6. Build the OJS package and patch files:

    tools/buildpkg.sh <VERSION> <TAG> <PATCH_DIR>
    
    (<PATCH_DIR> is the path to a directory containing previous OJS release
     packages against which to build patches)


7. Place the new package, patches, and version descriptor on the OJS web site:

    http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/download/
    http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/download/patch/
    http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs-version.xml
